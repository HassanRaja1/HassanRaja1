      <h2>Recommendations to Policy Makers</h2>
      <p>
        To address the ethical concerns surrounding spaceflight, policy makers should implement the following recommendations:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          1. Increase funding for reusable rocket technology and research into sustainability practices for space operations. This would help to reduce the environmental impact of spaceflight and promote more sustainable practices in the industry.
        </li>
        <li>
          2. Provide grants for universities and startups researching technologies like refueling spacecraft in orbit. This would further reduce waste and promote the development of more sustainable space technologies.
        </li>
        <li>
          3. Facilitate unified support across nations to achieve more scientific advances faster. This would allow for greater collaboration and resource sharing among countries, leading to more efficient and effective space exploration efforts.
        </li>
        <li>
          4. Pass updated legislation to support commercial space industry growth while protecting public safety and transparency. This would help to ensure that the commercial space industry is able to grow responsibly while maintaining the safety of the public.
        </li>
        <li>
          5. Incentivize private companies to adopt responsible AI practices for spacecraft. This would help to ensure that AI is used safely and ethically in spaceflight operations.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Recommendations to Aerospace Companies</h2>
      <p>
        Aerospace companies should also take steps to address the ethical concerns surrounding spaceflight. Here are some recommendations:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          1. Commit to sustainability from the early spacecraft design phase. This would involve using recyclable and reusable materials whenever possible and minimizing waste.
        </li>
        <li>
          2. Research renewable on-orbit energy harvesting like solar. This would help to reduce the reliance on fossil fuels and promote the use of sustainable energy sources in space.
        </li>
        <li>
          3. Provide substantial employee safety education aligned with emerging commercial spaceflight scenarios. This would help to ensure that employees are prepared for the risks of spaceflight and are able to work safely in this environment.
        </li>
        <li>
          4. Embed ethics oversight processes early for AI and autonomous technology development. This would help to ensure that AI is developed and used in a way that is aligned with human values and priorities.
        </li>
      </ul>
